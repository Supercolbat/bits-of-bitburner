## Whats inside?

* [Auto-Infiltration](https://github.com/Supercolbat/bits-of-bitburner/src/inferno.js) - It's fast. *Really* fast.

* [Neofetch](https://github.com/Supercolbat/bits-of-bitburner/src/bin/neofetch.js) - Show off your (ingame) specs

* [Shell history expansion](https://github.com/Supercolbat/bits-of-bitburner/src/bin/_expand_.js) - Prefix a command with `!` to run from history.

   - `run myscript.js`
   - `ls`
   - `! run` *(Autocompletes to `!run myscript.js`)*

## Is that it?

While there definitely are more scripts in this repository, they're either incomplete or not worth showing off (yet!).

## Goals

* Recreate a bash shell as closely as possible
* Set up Typescript and/or ESLint
* DOOM emulator
* Benchmarking script
* [Batching](https://bitburner-official.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advancedgameplay/hackingalgorithms.html#batch-algorithms-hgw-hwgw-or-cycles)
* ~~Make the infiltrate faster~~
